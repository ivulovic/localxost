<p>When accessing to the route, if you have your app connected to the NgRx Store, it's useful first to check if that data exists in store, or if
it's not there, then check does it exist in the database. For that, when we want to access route <b>/articles/:id</b> we should take that article from
the store, if it's not in store then we should load it from the server and put it in store.</p>

<p>For example if we are on route <b>/articles</b> where we have our article entities loaded, and we navigate to the <b>article/55621</b> we want to take
<b>entities[55621]</b> from the store. That's loaded in a millisecond because the data is already there in store and ready for use and display.</p>

<p>Sometimes we have a situation that we came to the page with route <b>article/55621</b> from some other page, for example someone gave us a link. In that case
we have don't have entities in store, so the entity fetching from store will fail. In that case we should load it from the server and put it into the store.
  In that way app won't break and we will have our data just there.
</p>

<p>Here's an example of the guard where we do exactly what is described above.</p>

<Code title="article-exist.guard.ts">
<pre>
...
export class ArticleExistsGuard implements CanActivate&#123;
  constructor(private store: Store&lt;reducers.State&gt;, private articleService: ArticleService,  private router: Router) &#123;&#125;
  canActivate(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot) &#123;
    return this.hasArticle(route.params['articleId']);
  &#125;
  hasArticle(id: string): Observable&lt;boolean&gt; &#123;
    return this.hasArticleInStore(id).pipe(
      switchMap(inStore =&gt; &#123;
        if (inStore) &#123;
          return of(inStore);
        &#125;
        return this.hasArticleInApi(id);
      &#125;)
    );
  &#125;
  hasArticleInStore(id: string): Observable&lt;boolean&gt; &#123;
    return this.store.pipe(
      select(selectors.getArticleEntities),
      map(entities =&gt;  !!entities[id]),
      take(1)
    );
  &#125;
  hasArticleInApi(id: string): Observable&lt;boolean&gt; &#123;
    return this.articleService.getArticle(id).pipe(
      map(articleEntity =&gt; &#123;
        return articleEntity ? new ArticleActions.LoadArticle(articleEntity) : new Error();
      &#125;),
      tap((action: ArticleActions.LoadArticle) =&gt; this.store.dispatch(action)),
      map(article =&gt; &#123;
        return !!article
      &#125;),
      catchError(() =&gt; &#123;
        this.router.navigate(['/404']);
        return of(false);
      &#125;)
    );
  &#125;
&#125;  
</pre>  
</Code>

<p>Here we in all cases return <b>Observable&lt;boolean&gt;</b>. In that way we will access to the page if data is found, or we will be redirected to NotFound page if there's no data.</p>

<p>If you're building a website where data is not changing every minute then this solution can also be used when we are on <b>/articles</b> route.
  We can have for example ArticlesLoaded guard where we will check if there is something in store, if there is not
then we will load it from server. Next time we navigate on the page data will be loaded and we won't do useless http request.</p>
